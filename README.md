# Recording Screen by JS.
最近在帮着杨老师(杨铸)做一个OJ平台，要实现线上考试的功能。这里就需要对学生的屏幕和摄像头进行录制，防止作弊。平台上还需要一个人脸识别的功能，但不是我做。虽然很喜欢人工智能和计算机图形学，但是自己目前的能力不够，就没有弄。

Recently, I am codeing an OJ platform with Teacher Yang (Yang Zhu). And we need implement a feature that can record students' screen and camera to prevent cheating. The platform also need a face recognition feature, but I am not doing it. Although I like AI. and computer graphics very much, but my current ability is not enough, so I didn't do it.

代码目前很乱，不过大概功能已经实现了。代码整理的话，再等等吧。

The codes are very mess now, but the features have been implemented basicly. Tiding up the codes? Em, wait several day.
